<p> I am a computational chemist with a strong focus on physics-based modeling and AI-assisted decision making in drug discovery. My work emphasizes
reproducible pipelines, rigorous validation, and interpretable results that can meaningfully support medicinal chemistry and project decisions.

## Technical Focus
- **Free Energy Perturbation**
  - Absolute hydration free energy (ΔG_hyd)
  - Protein–ligand absolute binding free energy (ABFE)
  - Protocol validation, convergence, and uncertainty analysis

- **Molecular Dynamics & Simulation**
  - OpenMM, NAMD, CHARMM, Desmond
  - System preparation, equilibration, and production workflows
  - Debugging and performance-aware simulation design

- **AI & Cheminformatics**
  - AI-assisted virtual screening (e.g., DiffDock)
  - ADME and property prediction with machine learning
  - Integration of AI models with MD and free energy calculations

---

This site serves as a **technical portfolio and research notebook**. It documents:
- end-to-end pipeline design decisions
- validation strategies for free energy calculations
- exploratory work integrating AI with physics-based modeling

For a curated overview of my work, see the **[Projects](/projects/)** page.
