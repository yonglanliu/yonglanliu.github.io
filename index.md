Welcome 👋  

I am a computational chemist focusing on:
- Free Energy Perturbation (FEP / RBFE / ABFE)
- Molecular Dynamics (OpenMM, NAMD, CHARMM)
- AI & Cheminformatics for Drug Discovery

This blog documents my **independent and collaborative projects**, including:
- OpenMM-based free energy pipelines
- AI-driven virtual screening and ADME modeling
- Fragment-based and structure-based drug design
