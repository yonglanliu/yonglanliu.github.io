**Computational Chemist | Free Energy Methods | AI for Drug Discovery**

I design and validate **physics-based and AI-assisted computational pipelines**
to support decision making in drug discovery, with a focus on:

- Free energy calculations (hydration, ABFE)
- Molecular dynamics (OpenMM, NAMD, CHARMM)
- AI/ML for virtual screening and ADME prediction

This site serves as a **technical portfolio and research notebook** documenting:
- end-to-end pipeline design
- validation strategies and diagnostics
- future integration of AI with physics-based methods

👉 Start with **[Projects](./projects/)** for a curated overview.
