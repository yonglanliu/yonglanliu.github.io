## 🔬 OpenMM-based Free Energy Pipeline (FEP / ABFE)
**Physics-based binding affinity estimation for drug discovery**

**What I built**
- A reproducible OpenMM-based pipeline for hydration free energy and protein–ligand ABFE
- Modular workflow separating system setup, simulation execution, and analysis
- Designed for benchmarking, debugging, and future AI integration

**Why it matters**
- Hydration free energy used as a calibration gate before ABFE
- Emphasizes reproducibility, uncertainty, and diagnostics
- Reflects industry-style protocol thinking rather than one-off scripts
